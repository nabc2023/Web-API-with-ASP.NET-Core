Web API with ASP.NET Core
Description: This project creates a simple Web API for managing a collection of books. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the book collection using HTTP methods.

Instructions:

1. Create a new ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
2. Copy and paste the provided C# code into the appropriate files (e.g., BooksController.cs).
3. Define a Book class (if not already present) with appropriate properties (e.g., Id, Title, Author, etc.).
4. Build and run the application; it should start a local web server.
5. Use a tool like Postman or any HTTP client to interact with the API. You can send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to /api/books and /api/books/{id} to perform CRUD operations on the book collection.
